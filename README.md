# ML task with tensor flow
## Description
Churn (attrition) in the context of a subscriber-based service model is the measure of the
number of individuals that leave the supplier during a given time period. Churn rate is a
possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the
competition, more successful sales and/or marketing by the competition, or reasons having
to do with the customer life cycle.

Predicting churn is a very important factor for service providers that allows for taking
various actions that prevent churn and avoid revenue loss.

## Task
Given the provided dataset, build and evaluate a model for a telco that predicts churn.

## Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes:
- Churn: customers who churned in the last month, the target variable
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers: gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## Expected output
- Please provide all the code that you used including data cleaning, visualization, processing, model training and evaluation.
- Ensure to explain any assumptions and decision that you are making to demonstrate your thought process when analysing the data and deciding on the best approach to build the model. We’d love to learn how you are thinking about various challenges when building a predictive model.
- Even though we don’t prescribe the solution when on the job, in this challenge, we would like you to demonstrate your knowledge of TensorFlow.
- Please use the High Level TensorFlow API (e.g. Estimators).
- Please share the results as a gist, dropbox, or encrypted file.
